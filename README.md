# Mine-game
This is a python game where as it will detect the mine automatically when it starts the game.There is a mine field near a beach. The mine removing team has divided the field into square areas and marked the mine detected areas. Then, they put a label on the mine free areas to indicate whether the nearby areas have mines or not..Unfortunately, due to a hurricane occurred in the costal area, the entire field is covered with sand and only the boarders of the squared areas are visible. The mine removing team has already returned the mine detector to another group. As a solution, they decided to use high presure water gun to remove the sand. However, fast moving water can activate the mines. The team remembers that the squares at the both edges of the strip are mine free and 8 out of 25 squares in the strip have mines. The label that indicate whether the surrounding areas have mines can be recovered once the presurized water is sprayed on the square area. Consider the agent has two high pressure water guns and it can use only one gun at a time. If it mistakenly activates a mine full area, the next agent can use the remaining high pressure water gun to continue the mine identification task.
